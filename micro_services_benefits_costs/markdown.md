Iâ€™ve been involved in making web software for about 22 years. I design and
write code, talk about code, play with my son, ride my bicycle, root for the
Timbers, drink beer, and once in a while sleep.

# Why am I here?
## To discuss some hard choices concerning micro-services.
???
Several years ago I went to a talk on micro-services here at OS-Bridge. [_Personal Story_]
* We were doing the same things they were
* Only talked about what was going right

__There are some hurdles to micro-services which should be shared.__

# Why Micro-services?
## Specifically, What Were Our Objectives?
---
## Scalability

Customer size and resource utilization vary drastically. Customer bandwidth
requirements tend to be low to moderate with spikes during the calendar year.
Some application features/components are utilized far more than others.

.center[<img src="./images/Logos for WS6Demo-Nov2015.png" style="height:300px;padding-top:40px;">]
???
* Every customer is different.
* They represent different sectors of the business world.
* Their needs are different.

[_Last sentence_] __Some application features/components are utilized far more than others.__

## Micro-services would allow us to scale<br>specific business components independent<br>of other business components.

---
## Flexibility

Customer requirements are evolving as new technologies arise. This results in
the need to be able to integrate these new technologies into or with our
application and the need for our existing functionality being adaptable to
the future needs of our customers.

.center[<img src="./images/web_technology.png" style="height:200px;padding-top:60px;">]

???
* Customer needs evolve over time.
* New technologies present integration opportunities.
* Functionality needs to be adaptable.

__Interestingly, businesses expect applications to support their business needs.__

## Maintainability

Advances in technology, new security concerns, and evolving customer needs
require rapid development. We expect that 50-80% of the code today will be
obsolete in 5 years. The application must be able to handle changes without
degrading quality.

```php
//
//     set_local_conf($directory, $variable, $value)
//        Place the $variable/$value pair in the $local_conf file that
//        exist in the $directory. If the $$local_conf file does not exist
//        then create one.  
//
function set_local_conf($directory, $variable, $value) 
{
  $local_conf = '.htconf';

  $file =  $directory . "/" . $local_conf;

  // Open the file, it will be created if it doesn't exist
  if ( !file_exists( $directory . "/" . $local_conf )) {
    $fp = fopen ( $file, "a+" );
  }
  else {
    $fp = fopen ( $file, "r+" );
  }
  
  // Now walk throught the file and try to find an entry 
  // in the file
  $added_line=FALSE;
  $index=1;
  $file_lines = array();
  rewind($fp);  
  while ($line = fgets( $fp, 255)) {
    // lets ignore the php start end php end marks for now
    if ( !strstr ($line, '?>') &&
     !strstr ($line, '<?') ) {
      if (strstr ($line, $variable)) {
    $file_lines[$index]= $variable . " = '" . $value  . "';\n";
    $added_line = TRUE;
      }
      else {
    $file_lines[$index]=$line;
      }
    }
    $index++;
  }

  // If the value didn't already exist then lets add it at the end
  if ( !$added_line ) {
    $file_lines[$index]= $variable . " = '" . $value  . "';\n";
    $index++;
  } 

  // Add beginning marks
  $file_lines[0]= '<?' . "\n";

  // Now lets rewrite the file
  rewind($fp);
  for ($i=0 ; $i<=$index; $i++) {
      if (isset ($file_lines[$i])) {
          $newline = $file_lines[$i];
          fwrite ($fp, $newline);
      }
  }
  fclose ($fp);
  chmod ($file, 0664);
}

# #1.
## Misjudged the complexity.
???
* While a micro-service may be simple compared to a 1 million line monolith.
* A collection of micro-services is a whole new kind of complex.
* [_Reality check_] Complexity is the essance of coding; You cannot have code without it.
---
## Interfaces, Interfaces, Interfaces.

.center[<img src="./images/interfaces.png" style="width:700px;padding-top:90px">]
???
* Micro-services have interfaces.
* With a lot of services, come a lot of interfaces.

## Interfaces, Interfaces, Interfaces.


* __Documentation__
  * Automated Code Documentation
  * Automated API Documentation
  * Architectural Documentation

]
???
* Document the code and automate documentation; This is just common sense.
* API documentation is a must; There is a horrible lack of tools for automating.
* Architecture: Pay special attention to inter-service dependencies.

* Make sure you know when things go wrong.
* Make sure you can figure out what went wrong.

# #2.
## Forgot to ask the customer what they needed.
???
* [_Read it!_]
* Micro-services solve some problems.
* But present some as well.

# How has this changed what we do?
---
## Product/UX/Architecture Three Month Plan
???
* Have to get ahead of it.
* Find dependency issues early and figure out how to deal with them.
---
## Product/UX/Architecture Three Month Plan

## REST can not solve everything
???
* Not everything fits "REST".
* Use it's concept of utilizing the protocol.
* Don't force evey protocol to be HTTP.
---
## Product/UX/Architecture Three Month Plan

## REST can not solve everything

## Duplication is not evil
???
* 1) Disk space is cheap/Processing is expensive.
* 2) If you standardize your architecture, your services will duplicate.
* 3) I have the same line copied on 4 of these slides.

## Product/UX/Architecture Three Month Plan

## REST can not solve everything

## Duplication is not evil

## Error handling is critical
???
* You have to deal with errors.
* You have to deal with them well.
