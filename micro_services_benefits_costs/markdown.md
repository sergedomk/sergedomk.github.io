Iâ€™ve been involved in making web software for about 22 years. I design and
write code, talk about code, play with my son, ride my bicycle, root for the
Timbers, drink beer, and once in a while sleep.

# Why am I here?
## To discuss some hard choices concerning micro-services.
---
class: center, middle
# Why Micro-services?
## Specifically, What Were Our Objectives?
---
## Scalability

Customer size and resource utilization varies drastically. Customer bandwidth
requirements tend to be low to moderate with spikes during the calendar year.
Some application features/components are utilized far more than others.

## Micro-services would allow us to scale<br>specific business components independent<br>of other business components.

## Flexibility

Customer requirements are evolving as new technologies arise. This results in
the need to be able to integrate these new technologies into or with our
application and the need for our existing functionality being adaptable to
the future needs of our customers.

## Interfaces represent business logic which tend<br>to be easy to adapt to external services.

## Maintainability

Advances in technology, new security concerns, and evolving customer needs
require rapid development. We expect that 50-80% of the code today will be
obsolete in 5 years. The application must be able to handle changes without
degrading quality.
